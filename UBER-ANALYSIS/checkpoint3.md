##Group 2/ Section 30

1) 
In the last 2 weeks we:
* did more work on data sets, since our project is on sentimental analysis we worked more on finding the useful reviews among a alot of junk that we found from twitter 
and facebook. We used webscrapers in order to pull the reviews. We actually had planned to use Twitter and Facebook API but unfortunalely we were restricted in 
scraping the UBER reviews. SO we used OUTWIT software by which we pulled 1000+ comments from which we got 50+ useful reviews and others were junk.
* worked on developing a java code which takes the reviews of customers and which displays positive or negative based on the keywords and the NLTP frequency given to 
the words.
* were new to the java and this sentimental analysis platform we worked on different algrithems from which we got different results. These results were pretty wrong, 
So we are still developing a code in java which will be of same format but with different coding and analysis of sentiments of UBER reviewss.

2) 
In the next 2 weeks we will:
* Develop entire data sets along with exact positive or negative feelings from teh customers.
* submit the code which will give the results of positive or negative, based on the review we enter.
* Document all the results along with the report, which will give the instructions to execute the code.
* Update all the required fields on proposal and will submit a paper presentation which gives more information about the UBER sentimental anaysis using Paper 
presnetation.
