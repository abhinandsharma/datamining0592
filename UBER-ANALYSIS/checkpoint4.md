##CHECKPOINT#4 UPDATE 4/25/16

#GROUP 2 / SECTION 30

1) 
In the last week we have:
Completed our coding part, we have entire code now for the analysis. We have tested on our code in which everything is working well and clear. In this we used TFIDF scores in order to separate positive and negative reviews. We have documented our output as screen shots on GITHUB.  

2) 
In the next week we will:
*Complete the entire documentation of our project along with the execution process, Screen shots, and data sets on GITHUB
Complete the entire proposal with all the expected fields on GITHUB.
3) 
* As we planned to distribute our coding work between us, we did entire coding work. 
*Our team Abhiannd and Kiran worked on testing process; since we chosen TFIDF based results it was very hard to generate some good results. 
*Ajay worked on developing the report and documentation part.
