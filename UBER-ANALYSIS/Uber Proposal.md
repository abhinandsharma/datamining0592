# UBER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

##Overview
This project mainly works on the sentiment analysis for Uber, This Uber is a transport service provider available almost in ten countries around the globe. This usually comes with an application available on all the smart phones on all the operating systems. This also works on the TFIDF scores i.e.,  term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency. Now my project will clasify the positive and negative feelings of customers using their reviews either posted on facebook or twitter. This mainly takes some reviews and trains the data accoring to the positive and negative analysis, after that autometically it will apply the reviews on test data and classifies the positive and negative reviews from the customers.

## Sentiment analysis
  Sentiment analysis in other words defined as opinion mining. In essence, it is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention.This sentimental analysis is usually used by the bussiness people or any web service providors to know the customers or people opinion on their work, a feedback from customers. This analysis will give us the positive or negative reviews on the customer opinions. For example we can consider obama administration used the sentimental analysis to review the people opinion on the comming elections.
  
## DATASET
Uber sentiment analysis requires some data or reviews for the customers which contains both positive and negative reviews. For the data we will develop the Facebook API or Twitter API where we can pull the reviews of uber based on the customer feelings about a post. We also try to use some tools like Outwit, web scrapers which will help us in pulling the comments based n our needs. We also have some other source of data from one of the team members who worked on Text analysis from other company. We already contacted with the company people about our needs regarding the project and the data.

## Project Management
Our project consits of two people Ajay gaddam(0513), kiran kumar(0458). In this Ajay Gaddam will be working on Facebook and Twitter API development in pulling the comments. Kiran kumar will be working on testing the pulled comments and final resting and reporting of the entire documentation.
