# UBER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

##Overview
This project mainly works on the sentiment analysis for UBER, This UBER is a transport service provider available almost in ten countries around the globe. This usually comes with an application available on all the smart phones on all the operating systems. This also works on the TFIDF scores i.e.,  term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency. Now my project will classify the positive and negative feelings of customers using their reviews either posted on FACEBOOK or TWITTER. This mainly takes some reviews and trains the data according to the positive and negative analysis, after that automatically it will apply the reviews on test data and classifies the positive and negative reviews from the customers.

## Sentiment analysis
  Sentiment analysis in other words defined as opinion mining. In essence, it is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention. This sentimental analysis is usually used by the bussiness people or any web service providers to know the customers or people opinion on their work, a feedback from customers. This analysis will give us the positive or negative reviews on the customer opinions. For example we can consider Obama administration used the sentimental analysis to review the people opinion on the coming elections.
  
## DATASET
UBER sentiment analysis requires some data or reviews for the customers which contains both positive and negative reviews. For the data we will develop the FACEBOOK API or TWITTER API where we can pull the reviews of UBER based on the customer feelings about a post. But development of this API is very difficult as they were restricted from pulling the comments of the UBER from FACEBOOK. So we used OUTWIT to pull the comments. Outwit is a software available on web for we scraping. This uses some multiple hash tag commands in order to pull the data. Our team mata ajay is more concentrated on pulling the comments. Using the OUTWIT we got around 100+ reviews, we filtered junk from those reviews and finally we got twenty useful reviews which shows exact feelings from customers on UBER.
Some example reviews that we scraped using OUTWIT are:

- Gud app Recent update made this app bad..always no cars available n surging in uberx option.. POSITIVE
- Very poor service-  I have coupons but after completing my ride Uber has charged cash, executives told that my coupon deemed invalid. Poor service, bad drivers. Total disgusting.  NEGATIVE
- Good service. Good app-I like the app and love the service. The app should really add a tipping function though POSITIVE
- Love Uber-  Love uber every driver I've rode with is so professional and fun to chat with, I never have a problem  keep up the good work!  POSITIVE

##Research Questions:
Uber sentiment analysis mainly works on predicting the reviews of customers based on their feelings.
The research questions are as follows:
- How to predict the feelings or experiences of customers using traing data and clsutering?
- How to avoid the words that are most used, that is stop words?
- What are the overall features of the customers on UBER service?

##Code and application
We use java as our main source to develop the clustering code for Uber analysis. We started researching about the algorithems which involve in clustring process. But as a defult algorithem we use KMEANS algorithem in order to perform this analysis.


## Project Management
Our project consists of two people Ajay Gaddam(0513), Kiran Kumar(0458). In this Ajay Gaddam as we were restricted in pulling comments using facebook API we planned to use OUTWIT which is web available software to scrape the comments on UBER from FACEBOOK and TWITTER. Kiran kumar will be working on testing the pulled comments and final resting and reporting of the entire documentation.

|03/22/2016| Classifying datasets| Abhinand, Kiran| Classifying the keywords which represent positive and negative expression in the reviews, We pulled 100+ reviews in which more junk reviews were removed. Abhinand worked on filtering the useful comments, Kiran worked on classifing the positive and negative comments|
